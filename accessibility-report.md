## Universal Design Principles

### Principle 1: Equitable Use
- The application is designed so that login, search, and review features work the same way for all users.
- Future iterations could include localization options to serve users in multiple languages.

### Principle 2: Flexibility in Use
- Users can search recipes by ingredient, dietary preference, or saved favorites.
- Touch, mouse, and keyboard interactions are planned so that navigation does not require a specific input device.

### Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use
- Screens such as login and search present clear labels and step-by-step flows.
- Tooltips and example inputs could be added to guide new users through complex tasks.

### Principle 4: Perceptible Information
- Labels and buttons are paired with icons and text to convey meaning.
- A high-contrast theme and adjustable text sizes could be added to considered to improve readability for users with visual impairments.

### Principle 5: Tolerance for Error
- Confirmation dialogs prevent accidental deletions or irreversible actions like removing friends or saved recipes.
- Undo options and informative error messages could further reduce the impact of mistakes.

### Principle 6: Low Physical Effort
- Common actions such as saving or sharing recipes are accessible within a few clicks.
- Keyboard shortcuts may be introduced so frequent users can perform tasks without extensive movement.

### Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use
- The interface is responsive and adjusts to different window sizes, ensuring all elements remain reachable.
- Large buttons and adequate spacing help users who have limited precision or use assistive devices.

## Target Audience
This program would be marketed toward home cooks and food enthusiasts who want personalized recipe suggestions. Busy students and professionals who need quick meal ideas could rely on the search and save features. Social eaters who enjoy sharing recipes and reviews with friends would also find value in the friend and messaging components.

## Demographic Considerations
The program may be less accessible to users without reliable internet access or modern devices capable of running a graphical interface. Individuals unfamiliar with technology, such as some elderly users, might find the app daunting without additional guidance. Additionally, reliance on English-language text and recipe sources could limit use among non-English speakers, reflecting broader concerns about inclusivity and data representation highlighted in the embedded ethics modules.
